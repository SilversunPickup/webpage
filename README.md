Creating a portfolio Website


This is my first day of creating my own portfolio Website. I m trying to update it frequently.

It mainly consists of .js, bootstrap, jquery, css and html files.

All images used are free stocks from the internet.

You can find them here:

www.icons8.com
www.pexels.com


One needs to add a CV at a place in the bottom part of the webpage, I deleted the part but left the code for the greater good. Link leads to nowhere for now
